DAY 2 YOUR FIRST LOCAL REPOSITORY
So you have a locally set up your environment to work with git commands. To confirm correct installation and configuration from Day001, run the following health checks:

git --version

This command confirms git is installed and accessible.

git config --global --list

This command will list all configuration values defined at the global level.

Step1: Instantiate git inside a new folder in your local environment
The star of the show here is git init Simple and straighforward. First, create a new directory and move into it, for my example I used git-challenge as the name. I am working with bash as my command line tool, you can use the tool of your choice. mkdir git-challenge cd git-challenge Once inside git-challenge directory, run command git init. This will do several things, most importantly, create a hidden .git/ directory which holds metadata, configurations, references and everything git needs to track your work. git-challenge is now a git repository.

To confirm this, run our next command, git status. You should see details about your working tree and the branch within which you are working; more on this later.

Step2: Working Tree? What is that?
Git manages your work in three distict states. Within the git environment, your changes will move across these three areas.

The Working Tree - this is area holds files or changes to files that you are currently working on. For example if I simply created a file inside git-challenge without notifying git, then my work would show up as an untracked file after running git status. Git will notify me within the command output that I have an untracked file. To allow staging and tracking I MUST add my changes to the next area: the staging area.

The Staging Area - changes and files added at this point are ready for active tracking. Git records the snapshots of your changes and they are queued to be added to the active tracking environment, the local repository. N.B you will often have to add your modifications to git's staging area to effectively queue changes to be added to your or git add <file-name> (to track modifications to one file)

The Local Repository - this is the place where all your checkpoints are added after you commit them. Once a change is added to the staging area then commited, it moves to your local repository area an is saved along with other descriptors for comparison with new changes or future retrieval. Running git commit facilitates the migration of your changes from the staging area to your local repository for tracking with the tools inside .git/ that we mentioned.

Step3: Commit some changes
Create a new notes markdownfile: touch notes.md Add it to your staging area: git add notes.md Open your notes document and add any note that you may want to keep. Add your new changes to the staging area: git add notes.md Commit your changes to your local repository: git commit -m "added notes document to my repository"

Post your commit message to the discord challenge thread for your first successful commit.
git add.
